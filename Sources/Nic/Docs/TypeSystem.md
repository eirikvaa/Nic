#  Type system

As I have just learned, Swift bases its type system implementation on the Hindley-Damas-Milner type system, which, in Wikipedias own words, is

> (...) a classical type system for lambda calculus with parametric polymorphism.

They use it for type inference, and since it's seemingly such a classical algorithm to implement, I would very much like to try to implement it myself. Type inference is also something I would see for my language.
